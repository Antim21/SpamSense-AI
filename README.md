# SpamSense-AI

This project focuses on classifying emails into Spam or Not Spam categories using Machine Learning techniques. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and provides a step-by-step approach to building and evaluating the classification model.

**Key Features**
Preprocessing of raw email data (e.g., cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization).
Implementation of multiple classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.
Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization of results through plots and charts for better understanding.
